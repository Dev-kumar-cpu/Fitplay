# FitPlay Web (Prototype)

This is a lightweight Vite + React prototype of the FitPlay app.

Quick start:

```bash
cd web
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open http://localhost:5173

Notes:

- The web prototype uses mock services in `src/services`.
- To enable Firebase, replace mocks with Firestore calls and add your config.
